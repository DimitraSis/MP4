Both models have similar accuracy and performance metrics.

- **Decision Tree Classifier:**
- Higher precision for predicting attrition (1), but lower recall.
- Better at correctly identifying non-attrition cases (0).
- Good overall accuracy.

- **Naïve Bayes Classifier:**
- Slightly better recall for predicting attrition (1), but lower precision.
- Better at correctly identifying attrition cases.
- Good overall accuracy.

- Naïve Bayes is slightly better
